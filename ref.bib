  abstract = 	{The purpose of this thesis is to show that a certain kind of
agent-based model can generate a series of social phenomena, and
many of them may be quite close to reality. Instead of emphasizing
the microscopic aspect of "utility maximization", we emphasize
more that of a "statistical equilibrium", a stage that economy
will generally fluctuate around. Through agent-based simulations,
some seemingly puzzling stylized facts in macroeconomics can be
replicated without too much effort.

The first part of the thesis has introduced an agent-based model
describing the social production process, which consists of
employment, production and consumption. The biggest advantage of
this model is that: it generates many macroscopic regularities
from microscopic behavior within a single framework, involving
intricate interactions among simple micro-economic entities. In
particular, the model is capable of explaining many stylized facts,
including the frictional unemployment, the firm size distribution, growth distribution, wealth distribution, and etc.

The secon part of the thesis dig into the agent-based models of
opinion formation in order to find out whether the
subjective opinion dynamics may, to some extent, influence
objective economic variables. Particularly, we will investigate
how consumer sentiment or industrial sentiment can help to explain
or predict the movement of industrial production. We first offer a
forecast-oriented VAR analysis, in which different kinds of VAR models with various lags will be estimated and evaluated with respect to their overall forecast abilities for industrial production. In the next step, taking nonlinearity and interactions among sentiment and industrial production into account, we set up
an agent-based model of opinion formation following the pioneering
work of Weidlich and Haag (1983) to model the joint dynamics
of sentiment and output. A nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is
added to help in explaining the transient density of this
stochastic model. Then the model is further extended into two
dimensions. We observe a strong causal relation from industrial
sentiment to the output, which confirms our finding in the VAR analysis.},

abstract = {Recent decades have seen a rise in the use of physics methods to study different societal phenomena. This development has been due to physicists venturing outside of their traditional domains of interest, but also due to scientists from other disciplines taking from physics the methods that have proven so successful throughout the 19th and the 20th century. Here we characterise the field with the term ‘social physics’ and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migration, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with. Notwithstanding, it remains of the utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive dialogue and mutual respect at the interfaces of different scientific disciplines.}
